## Requirement

jQuery (1.9.0 or later)

note: jQuery 1.9.0 or later is strongly recommended because using jQuery less than 1.8.3 and jquery.onepage-scroll.js together turns out to be a hash-based XSS vulnerabiliry.

## Compatibility
Modern browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari on both desktop and smartphones have been tested. Not tested on IE.
